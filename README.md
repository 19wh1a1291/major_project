It is possible to share data using the cloud on a massive scale because it is location independent.
Customers can more easily access or share documents by sharing digital records in public cloud
storage. However, issues related to data privacy and security, simple data exchange, effective
delegation of authority and optimization of computing speed remain in the direction of achieving
practical access control within the framework of electronic document exchange. The proposed
system is an access control system and data exchange procedure for a system that fulfills all the
main characteristics in parallel and is suitable for resource-based devices. Mail notifications for One
Time Password are part of this project (One Time Password) to ensure more security and data
privacy. In addition, this system offers the possibility of automatic deletion. The file is
automatically deleted based on the expiration date specified by the user, so that memory is
optimized. The access control method will be used in a real-world environment, including public
cloud storage, a laptop, and a resource-constrained local server that is affordable. Practical results
show that the procedure is effective, practical and affordable.
